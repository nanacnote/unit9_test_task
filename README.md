## Architecture

```
+-- public
| +-- images
| +-- index.html
| +-- main.css

+-- src
| +-- animation
| +-- components
| +-- data
```

- contains all images to bypass webpack loading when running in node
- main HTML file to run for static builds
- main CSS with global styles
- contains or Javascript animation modules composed as classes
- contains all react components with an exports index file for easy ES6 importing
- contain a JSON object which populate the App with all the text needed
<<<<<<< HEAD

The App is modularized to allow for easy maintenance.

There is a JSON file in the data folder which is passed as a prop to the Layout.jsx component.

This JSON object contains all the text injections for the app. It is dynamic and once its Prototyping rules are followed,
infinite amounts of data can be passed to the app to display.
